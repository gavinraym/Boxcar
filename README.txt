    MR. NATURAL RULES AND INSTRUCTIONS

    Game accommodates as many players as can comfortably sit around a table.

    EQUIPMENT
    1.    Six standard dice.
    2.    An alias. 
    3.    A piece of paper and a pen or pencil to record the score.

    OBJECTIVE
    Be the first player to score 10,000 points to win the game.
    
    If you are still trying to think of the perfect alias, don't worry — you can 
    change your name as many times as you see fit during the game, as long as you 
    do so at the start of your turn. 

    GAMEPLAY
    1. Begin each turn by rolling all six dice. Once the scoring dice are counted, 
    set those dice aside and roll the remaining dice again. Continue rolling and 
    scoring until no scoring dice are left to roll.

    #2. Each player must first score at least 550 points in one turn to "get on the 
    #board" (begin listing and adding up points).

    #3. Once a player has reached the initial 550 points, the minimum score for a turn
    #is 350 points.  After a player has reached 350 points in a single turn, they may 
    #conclude their turn. Or, the player can continue rolling until all six dice have 
    #scored points.

    4. If, in a single turn, all six dice have scored and been set aside, the player 
    can then choose to roll all six dice again. However, if this roll produces no 
    scoring dice, all points earned in that turn are forfeited.

    5. A player’s turn is also forfeited if one of the dice rolls off the table. 

    SCORING
    A roll of a single 5 is worth 50 points. 

    A roll of a single 1 is worth 100 points. 

    A roll of three of the same number at once on three separate dice is worth that 
    number multiplied by 100. For instance, three 2's are worth 200, three 3's are 
    worth 300, three 4's are worth 400, and so on.  
    -An exception to this rule is a roll of three 1's, which is worth 1000
    points. 

    If four or more of the same number are rolled at once, the first three dice are 
    scored as above. After that, each additional die is worth that score again. For 
    instance, four 4's are worth 800, five 5's are worth 1500, and six 6's are worth 
    2400. 

    A roll of three pairs will score 1000 points. This is known as a Boxcar. A player 
    who rolls a Boxcar must score the dice this way, regardless of the numbers on the 
    dice. 

    If a player rolls two pairs and two singles without rolling a lone 1 or 5, they’ve 
    rolled a Nothing. In this instance, the player must try to make a third pair by 
    rolling the remaining dice not already in a pair. For instance, let's say the player
    rolls two 2's, two 3's, a 4 and a 6. The player must pick up the die that rolled 
    the 4 to try to roll a 6 or pick up the die that rolled the 6 to try and roll a 4.
    If the player is able to roll the lone dice and complete three pairs, they earn 
    1000 points.

    If a player rolls a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 on a single roll, then congratulations — 
    you've rolled a Mr. Natural, worth 1500 points.

    GOOD LUCK!
